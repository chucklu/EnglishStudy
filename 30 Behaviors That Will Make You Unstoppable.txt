A lot of people are good at what they do. 
Some are even elite¾«Ó¢. 
However, a select few are completely Unstoppable. 
Those who are unstoppable are in their own world. 
They don¡¯t compete with anyone but themselves. 
You never know what they will do ¡ª only that you will be forced to respond. 
Even though they don¡¯t compete with you, they make you compete with them.

Let¡¯s get started:
1. Don¡¯t Think, Know And Act
Rather than analyzing and thinking, act. Attuned to your senses, and with complete trust in yourself, do what you instinctively feel you should. As Oprah has said, ¡°Every right decision I have ever made has come from my gut. Every wrong decision I¡¯ve made was the result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself¡±
The moment you start thinking, you¡¯ve already lost. Thinking swiftly pulls you out of the zone.
