A lot of people are good at what they do. 
Some are even elite精英. 
However, a select few are completely Unstoppable.   //a select few精选出来的少数
Those who are unstoppable are in their own world. 
They don’t compete with anyone but themselves. 
You never know what they will do ― only that you will be forced to respond. 
Even though they don’t compete with you, they make you compete with them.

Rather than analyzing and thinking, act. 
Attuned使...协调 to your senses感觉, and with complete trust in yourself, do what you instinctively本能地 feel you should. 
As Oprah has said, “Every right decision I have ever made has come from my gut直觉. 
Every wrong decision I’ve made was the result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself”
The moment you start thinking, you’ve already lost. 
Thinking swiftly pulls you out of the zone.
