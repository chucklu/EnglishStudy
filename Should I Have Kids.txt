My in-laws姻亲 are worried.

At least that’s what my husband Chris told me just now, half-joking. He was talking about a call with his parents, Stu and Ellen, who earlier this morning saw an article I shared on Facebook by the actress Joy Bryant on motherhood母亲身份, and her decision to forgo放弃;停止;对...断念 making and raising human beings.

Looking at the supportive comments and “Likes” on the Facebook post (the majority of them female friends and acquaintances熟人), I felt light and free for a moment thinking: wow, imagine if Chris and I really decide to focus on ourselves, our work, and each other instead of raising mini-me’s.

Among Chris’s friends, we’d be pretty average普通的. Many of the people he works with are enterprising有事业心的 and practical实际的, and way before we ever considered it an option, decided that children (marriage, even) wasn’t for them. And in my circle of friends, getting married last year meant I surrendered投降,屈服 my autonomy自治 and ovaries卵巢 earlier than most. If I decided to stop taking birth control this week, I’d be among the first of my best friends to risk parenthood——at thirty-two32岁! How refreshing. What a relief.

Considering and planning for parenthood is nothing new——not to me, not to anyone, it seems. After all, as women, our bodies are ready and able to make more of ourselves for perpetuity永恒. But though we’ve been raised抚育,抚养 to assume we should have kids, it’s never too late to challenge those assumptions假定,设想. And the first step to doing this is to ask where those assumptions come from in the first place.
